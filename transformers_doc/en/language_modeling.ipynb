It's not necessarily a bad thing for your body to react to the virus and not a bad thing for your immune system. It's the same as if you give a healthy person a flu shot. If you give a healthy person a vaccine, their immune system will react to certain viruses.It's a simple but very complex process. There are many factors that play into the main issue. One of the main is that a human immune system can't fully react to the virus, which is why humans can't effectively be immunized with the virus. So the other is that the immune system is unable to respond to many different viruses. The idea of a vaccine being given to a very sick person is that they simply don't know why. I've been told that a vaccine can't be passed out, or even cured. It's only that the immune system can respond to a very sick person, and so the immune system will probably not react to it.
